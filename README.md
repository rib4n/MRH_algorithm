Warning: Don't use this alogrithm. It's only an idea & wasn't testet + there is one bug

In finance, mean reversion is the assumption that a stock's price will tend to move to the average price over time.
Using mean reversion in stock price analysis involves both identifying the trading range for a stock and computing the average price using analytical techniques. Mean Reversion Hypothesis: When the 20-day SMA is lower than the 30-day SMA, open a long position. When the 10-daqy SMA is higher than the 30-day SMA, open a short position. Position size is proportional to the difference between the 10- & 30-day SMAs.
